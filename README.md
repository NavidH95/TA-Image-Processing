# Image Processing TA
Teaching Assistant: Masters course in Image Processing at FUM (Fall 2023 - Winter 2024)

I implemented some important materials with Python language in the Jupyter Notebook by studying some sources, especially the course reference book, and presenting them to the students weekly.

# Note
The reference book used for this course is **Digital Image Processing, 4th edition (by Rafael C. GONZALES and Richard E. Woods)**

# Update (10/10/2024)
Some new features have been added to Chapter 2 and previous bugs have been fixed.

# Update (4/10/2024)
In the winter semester of 2024, chapters 2, 3, and 12 were added to the previous codes.
